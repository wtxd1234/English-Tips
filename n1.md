## **Nouns (Naming Words)**

Nouns are words that name a **person**, **place**, **thing**, or **idea**.

* **Common Nouns**: General names for things. They are not capitalized unless they start a sentence.
    * *Examples*: city, dog, teacher, happiness
* **Proper Nouns**: Specific names for things. They are **always capitalized**.
    * *Examples*: Kuala Lumpur, Sparky, Mr. Tan, Buddhism
* **Abstract Nouns**: Names for ideas, qualities, or feelings that you cannot see or touch.
    * *Examples*: love, courage, knowledge, freedom
* **Collective Nouns**: Names for a group of people or things.
    * *Examples*: team, family, audience, flock
* **Countable vs. Uncountable Nouns**:
    * **Countable nouns** can be counted (e.g., one *book*, two *books*).
    * **Uncountable nouns** cannot be counted and don't usually have a plural form (e.g., *water*, *information*, *advice*). You measure them with units like "a glass of water" or "a piece of advice."

## **Verbs (Action & Being Words)**

Verbs express **action** or a **state of being**. Every sentence must have a verb.

* **Action Verbs**: Show a physical or mental action.
    * *Examples*: run, think, read, decide
* **Linking Verbs**: Connect the subject of a sentence to a word or phrase that describes it. They don't show action.
    * *Common examples*: be (is, am, are, was, were), seem, become, feel, look
    * *Sentence*: "She **is** a doctor." (connects "She" to "doctor")
* **Helping Verbs (Auxiliary Verbs)**: "Help" the main verb to express tense or mood.
    * *Common examples*: be, have, do, will, can, should, must
    * *Sentence*: "He **is** *walking*." (helps show the action is ongoing) "You **must** *finish* your homework." (helps express necessity)

### **Verb Tenses**

Tense tells you when the action happened. The three basic tenses are:
* **Past**: The action already happened. (e.g., "I **walked** home.")
* **Present**: The action is happening now or happens regularly. (e.g., "I **walk** home.")
* **Future**: The action will happen later. (e.g., "I **will walk** home.")

## **Adverbs (Words that Modify)**

Adverbs modify (describe) **verbs**, **adjectives**, or **other adverbs**. They often answer questions like *how?*, *when?*, *where?*, or *to what extent?*. Many, but not all, end in "-ly".

* **Modifying a Verb**: "She ran **quickly**." (How did she run?)
* **Modifying an Adjective**: "The soup was **very** hot." (How hot was it?)
* **Modifying another Adverb**: "He finished the test **incredibly** quickly." (How quickly did he finish?)

### **Types of Adverbs**

* **Adverbs of Manner**: Describe *how* something is done. (e.g., slowly, carefully, loudly)
* **Adverbs of Time**: Describe *when* something is done. (e.g., yesterday, now, later, soon)
* **Adverbs of Place**: Describe *where* something is done. (e.g., here, there, outside, everywhere)
* **Adverbs of Frequency**: Describe *how often* something is done. (e.g., always, sometimes, never, daily)

## **Prepositions (Relationship Words)**

Prepositions are small words that show the relationship between a noun (or pronoun) and other words in a sentence. They often indicate **location**, **time**, or **direction**.

* **Common Prepositions**: in, on, at, for, from, to, with, under, over, behind, before, after

* **Examples**:
    * "The book is **on** the table." (Location)
    * "The meeting is **at** 3 PM." (Time)
    * "He walked **to** the store." (Direction)

## **Sentence Structure: The Basics**

Understanding the building blocks of a sentence is crucial.

* **Subject**: Who or what the sentence is about.
    * "**The cat** sat on the mat."
* **Predicate**: What the subject is or does. It always includes the verb.
    * "The cat **sat on the mat**."
* **Clause**: A group of words containing a subject and a verb.
    * **Independent Clause**: A complete thought that can stand alone as a sentence. (e.g., "The sun is shining.")
    * **Dependent Clause**: An incomplete thought that cannot stand alone. It often starts with a subordinating conjunction. (e.g., "...because the sun is shining.")

## Adjectives (Words that Describe)

Adjectives are words that **describe or modify nouns** (people, places, things) **or pronouns** (he, she, it). They add detail and make your sentences more specific and interesting.

* *Example*: "The **big** dog barked at the **scared** cat." (Big describes the dog; scared describes the cat).

### Types of Adjectives

There are several types, but here are the most common ones:

1.  **Descriptive Adjectives**: These describe the quality or state of a noun. This is what most people think of as an adjective.
    * *Examples*: a **beautiful** painting, a **tall** building, a **happy** child.

2.  **Quantitative Adjectives**: These describe how much or how many.
    * *Examples*: **many** friends, **five** apples, **some** rice.

3.  **Demonstrative Adjectives**: These point out specific nouns.
    * *Examples*: **this** book, **that** car, **these** shoes, **those** birds.

4.  **Possessive Adjectives**: These show ownership.
    * *Examples*: **my** house, **your** idea, **his** phone, **their** team.

5.  **Interrogative Adjectives**: These are used in questions.
    * *Examples*: **Which** path should we take? **What** movie are you watching?

### Order of Adjectives

When you use multiple adjectives before a noun, they usually follow a specific order. A common acronym to remember this is **OSASCOMP**:

* **O**pinion (e.g., *lovely, awful*)
* **S**ize (e.g., *big, small*)
* **A**ge (e.g., *old, new*)
* **S**hape (e.g., *round, square*)
* **C**olour (e.g., *red, blue*)
* **O**rigin (e.g., *Malaysian, Italian*)
* **M**aterial (e.g., *wooden, plastic*)
* **P**urpose (e.g., *sleeping* bag, *running* shoes)

* *Example*: "She bought a **beautiful (Opinion) small (Size) old (Age) round (Shape) brown (Colour) wooden (Material)** table."

You rarely use all of them at once, but this order helps make sentences sound natural.

## Conjunctions (Words that Connect)

Conjunctions are **joining words**. They connect words, phrases, or clauses within a sentence.



### Types of Conjunctions

There are three main types:

1.  **Coordinating Conjunctions**: These connect words, phrases, or independent clauses (clauses that can be a sentence on their own) that are of equal importance.

    You can remember them with the acronym **FANBOYS**:
    * **F**or (explains a reason) - "I went to bed, **for** I was tired."
    * **A**nd (adds information) - "He likes tea **and** coffee."
    * **N**or (presents a second negative idea) - "She doesn't like apples, **nor** does she like oranges."
    * **B**ut (shows contrast) - "I want to go, **but** I am busy."
    * **O**r (presents a choice) - "Do you want pizza **or** pasta?"
    * **Y**et (shows contrast, similar to 'but') - "It was sunny, **yet** it was cold."
    * **S**o (shows a result) - "It was raining, **so** I took an umbrella."

2.  **Subordinating Conjunctions**: These connect an independent clause (a complete thought) with a dependent clause (a thought that cannot stand on its own). They show the relationship between the clauses (e.g., cause/effect, time, condition).

    * *Common examples*: **because, since, although, while, if, when, after, before, unless.**
    * "He went to the doctor **because** he was feeling unwell."
        * Independent clause: "He went to the doctor."
        * Dependent clause: "**because** he was feeling unwell."
    * "**Although** it was raining, we went for a walk."

3.  **Correlative Conjunctions**: These are pairs of conjunctions that work together to connect two balanced clauses, phrases, or words.

    * *Common pairs*:
        * **either... or** - "You can have **either** the cake **or** the ice cream."
        * **neither... nor** - "He is **neither** my friend **nor** my enemy."
        * **not only... but also** - "She is **not only** intelligent **but also** very kind."
        * **both... and** - "I like **both** watching movies **and** reading books."
